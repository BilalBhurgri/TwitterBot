mous reconstruction on challenging datasets and stable training over many iterations.

(iv) Finally, we provide insights into the scalability of the LDM framework and suggest possible avenues for future research in the direction of using LDMs for real-time applications and developing hybrid architectures that combine LDMs with other generative models. #HighResolutionImageSynthesiswithLatentDiffusionModels
