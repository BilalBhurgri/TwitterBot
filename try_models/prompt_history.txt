'🚀 A groundbreaking advancement in 3D scene reconstruction! VGGT, a feed-forward transformer, directly rebuilds 3D attributes from 1–N images ⚡️, outperforming prior methods in speed & accuracy across camera pose, multi-view depth, and point maps 🎯. No post-processing needed—VGGT’s predictions rival optimization techniques, even boosting results when paired with Bundle Adjustment! 🧠🔧 #AI #ComputerVision\n Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11651'

'real_tweet': '"A groundbreaking open-source library, #ByzFL, simplifies evaluating robust FL algorithms through standardized benchmarks & adversarial simulations 🧪📊. It supports advanced aggregation methods like MultiKrum, geometric median, and coordinate-wise median, alongside pre-aggregation techniques such as nearest neighbor mixing and adaptive clipping. ByzFL enables systematic testing of FL models against Byzantine clients via simulated attacks including Sign Flipping, Label Flipping, and optimized variations (Opt-IPM, Opt-ALIE). With a modular framework, single JSON config, and visualization tools, it empowers researchers to compare aggregation methods fairly, scalably, and reproducibly in adversarial settings. 🔬📈"\n Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24802'

Change made on June 7 because it kept inserting researcher name as if they made the paper the bot is posting about. NO! 
example = f'Talk in a similar style to this example. Example: {example_text}'
