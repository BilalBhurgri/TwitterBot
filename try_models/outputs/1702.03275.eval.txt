Okay, let's start by evaluating the factual consistency of each summary. 

For Summary 0, it mentions that Batch Renormalization ensures activations depend only on individual examples during training and inference. The source text states that Batch Renormalization ensures activations during both training and inference depend only on individual examples. It also talks about a per-dimension correction and treating correction parameters as fixed during backpropagation, which aligns with the source. The part about using moving averages during training and avoiding issues with minibatch size and non-i.i.d. samples is also supported. The experiments showing comparable or higher accuracy are mentioned, which the source discusses. So, Summary 0 seems consistent.

Summary 1 states that Batch Renormalization addresses minibatch dependency issues, leading to problems with non-i.i.d. and small minibatches. The source explains that batchnorm's dependency causes overfitting in such cases. The summary mentions that Batch Renormalization ensures activations match during inference, which
