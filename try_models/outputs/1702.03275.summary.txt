Batch Renormalization addresses the limitations of batch normalization in deep learning, particularly for small or non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-i.i.d.) minibatches. Traditional batch normalization computes statistics from the minibatch, leading to discrepancies between training and inference phases, which can hinder generalization. Batch Renormalization introduces a correction mechanism that ensures activations depend only on individual examples during both training and inference, aligning them with the inference model's behavior. This approach maintains the benefits of batch normalization, such as faster training and robustness to initialization, while mitigating issues arising from minibatch dependence. Experiments demonstrate that Batch Renormalization achieves comparable or superior accuracy on small minibatches and non-i.i.d. data compared to traditional batch normalization. It also improves performance on non-i.i.d. minibatches by reducing overfitting to specific distributions. The method is computationally efficient, with no additional cost, and enhances training stability, especially for models sensitive to minibatch dynamics.
