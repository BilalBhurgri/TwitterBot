The paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for sentence classification using pre-trained word vectors. The model employs a single convolutional layer on top of word vectors derived from an unsupervised neural language model trained on 100 billion words of Google News. Key findings show that even without fine-tuning, the pre-trained vectors serve as "universal" feature extractors, achieving strong performance on benchmark datasets like MR, SST-1, SST-2, Subj, TREC, CR, and MPQA. Fine-tuning the vectors further improves results. A multichannel architecture combines static pre-trained vectors with task-specific vectors, allowing simultaneous use of both. The model's simplicity and effectiveness highlight the importance of unsupervised pre-training in NLP. Experiments demonstrate that CNNs with minimal parameter tuning outperform many complex alternatives, emphasizing the utility of pre-trained embeddings in diverse classification tasks. The study supports the philosophy that pre-trained features can generalize across tasks, reducing the need for extensive task-specific training.
