{"title": "When Deep Learning Meets Information Retrieval-based Bug Localization: A Survey", "authors": ["Feifei Niu", "Chuanyi Li", "Kui Liu", "Xin Xia", "David Lo"], "abstract": "Bug localization is a crucial aspect of software maintenance, running through\nthe entire software lifecycle. Information retrieval-based bug localization\n(IRBL) identifies buggy code based on bug reports, expediting the bug\nresolution process for developers. Recent years have witnessed significant\nachievements in IRBL, propelled by the widespread adoption of deep learning\n(DL). To provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art and\ndelve into key issues, we conduct a survey encompassing 61 IRBL studies\nleveraging DL. We summarize best practices in each phase of the IRBL workflow,\nundertake a meta-analysis of prior studies, and suggest future research\ndirections. This exploration aims to guide further advancements in the field,\nfostering a deeper understanding and refining practices for effective bug\nlocalization. Our study suggests that the integration of DL in IRBL enhances\nthe model's capacity to extract semantic and syntactic information from both\nbug reports and source code, addressing issues such as lexical gaps, neglect of\ncode structure information, and cold-start problems. Future research avenues\nfor IRBL encompass exploring diversity in programming languages, adopting\nfine-grained granularity, and focusing on real-world applications. Most\nimportantly, although some studies have started using large language models for\nIRBL, there is still a need for more in-depth exploration and thorough\ninvestigation in this area.", "subjects": ["cs.SE"], "published": "2025-04-30T19:30:28+00:00"}
