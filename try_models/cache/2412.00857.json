{"title": "Coherent Video Inpainting Using Optical Flow-Guided Efficient Diffusion", "authors": ["Bohai Gu", "Hao Luo", "Song Guo", "Peiran Dong", "Qihua Zhou"], "abstract": "The text-guided video inpainting technique has significantly improved the\nperformance of content generation applications. A recent family for these\nimprovements uses diffusion models, which have become essential for achieving\nhigh-quality video inpainting results, yet they still face performance\nbottlenecks in temporal consistency and computational efficiency. This\nmotivates us to propose a new video inpainting framework using optical\nFlow-guided Efficient Diffusion (FloED) for higher video coherence.\nSpecifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where the time-agnostic\nflow branch restores corrupted flow first, and the multi-scale flow adapters\nprovide motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Besides, a training-free\nlatent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising\nprocess using flow warping. With the flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED\nefficiently reduces the computational cost of incorporating optical flow.\nExtensive experiments on background restoration and object removal tasks show\nthat FloED outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in both quality\nand efficiency. Our codes and models will be made publicly available.", "subjects": ["cs.CV"], "published": "2024-12-01T15:45:26+00:00"}
