{"title": "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification", "authors": ["Yoon Kim"], "abstract": "We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks (CNN)\ntrained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification\ntasks. We show that a simple CNN with little hyperparameter tuning and static\nvectors achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks. Learning\ntask-specific vectors through fine-tuning offers further gains in performance.\nWe additionally propose a simple modification to the architecture to allow for\nthe use of both task-specific and static vectors. The CNN models discussed\nherein improve upon the state of the art on 4 out of 7 tasks, which include\nsentiment analysis and question classification.", "subjects": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE"], "published": "2014-08-25T19:48:04+00:00"}
