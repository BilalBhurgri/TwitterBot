                "Using LLMs to build AI scientists is all the rage now (e.g., Google’s AI co-scientist [1] and Sakana’s Fully Automated Scientist [2]), but how much do we understand about their core scientific abilities? We know how LLMs can be vastly useful (solving complex math problems) yet unreliable (counting the number of 'R's in 'strawberry' or calculating 9.9 - 9.11) at the same time. Similarly, despite recent advances in applying LLMs to science, are we confident that they can reliably uncover the underlying mechanism of a simple black-box system in a controlled setting? We study this question in our new preprint: 📢👇 (1/n)",
                "[IMAGE] Doing science requires several skills: 1) Performing inductive reasoning based on passively observed data; 2) Actively interacting with a system to collect informative data and reduce uncertainty about its internal mechanisms; 3) Communicating the results. Based on these desiderata, we focus on the ability to reverse-engineer black-box systems as a core capability and a prerequisite to doing scientific research. (2/n)",
                "[IMAGE] 🤔How well can LLMs infer the internal mechanisms of black box systems from passive observations?  We looked at three kinds of black box systems inspired by cognitive studies: 1) list-mapping programs 2) rules of formal languages 3) parameters of math equations  Our findings suggest that, when limited to observational data, LLMs significantly underperform compared to Bayesian inference. However, active interventions substantially boost their performance!",
                "[IMAGE] 🤔Why do interventions help? Do they result in more informative observations, or is it the process of generating the interventions itself that matters?-- Inspired by the passive-yoked design from human learning studies [3], we find that active learning outperforms passive observation, as it allows the LLM to dynamically refine its hypotheses through targeted interventions. (4/n)",
                "[IMAGE] 🤔Can LLMs successfully transfer their experiment data and findings to other LLMs? The answer is not quite! Transferred interventions consistently underperform compared to LLMs conducting their own active interventions. (5/n)",
                "[IMAGE] Active intervention effectively mitigates two common failure modes across all three black-box systems we studied: 1) Overcomplication – LLM tends to construct overly-complex hypotheses; 2) Overlooking – LLM neglects observations and draws overly-generic conclusions without careful checking of the data. (6/n)",
                "[IMAGE] In summary, we show that LLMs still struggle to fully utilize passive observations to form hypotheses and allowing active intervention mitigates some of the failure modes. By evaluating their ability to reverse-engineer black-box systems, we offer a principled and controlled framework for probing a core scientific reasoning capability, providing insight into whether SoTA LLMs possess the foundational skills required to function as reliable AI scientists.

                "The GAIA game is over, and Alita is the final answer. Alita takes the top spot in GAIA, outperforming OpenAI Deep Research and Manus. Many general-purpose agents rely heavily on large-scale, manually predefined tools and workflows. However, we believe that for general AI assistants: 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.' 🔗Full paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20286 🔗More Details will be updated here: https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Alita #AI #Agent #LLM ",
                "[IMAGE] The reliance on large-scale manually predefined tools and workflows introduces several critical limitations: i) It is impractical, if not impossible, to predefine all the tools required for the wide variety of real-world tasks an agent might encounter (imcomplete coverage); ii) Many complex tasks require agents to creatively compose new tools or leverage existing ones in novel ways while pre-designed workflow and hardcoded components constrain this compositional flexibility and inhibit the development of adaptive behaviors (limited creativity and flexibility); iii) It is not always the case that the interface or environment of different tools are compatible with the agent (mismatch). For example, many useful tools are not written in Python, which makes it difficult, though not entirely impossible, for them to be pre-connected to the mainstream agent frameworks that are primarily written in Python. Together, these challenges ultimately hinder the scalability, adaptability, and generalization of existing generalist agents.",
                "In the abstract and Table 1 as well as the full paper, we point out that it is pass@3. Our pass@1 is 75.15% on GAIA validation, which also surpasses OpenAI Deep Research and Manus. However, some companies advertise their products without pointing out that it is pass@N or pass@1. To gain some attention in this environment, we are compelled to aggressively and shamelessly plot Figure 1 in this way. Also, if you take a closer look at comment 7 in https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Alita, you may better understand what I am referring to.  Another point worth noticing is my comment 4 on GitHub. Alita-generated MCPs, which can be viewed as manually designed by the agent instead of human developers through trial and error, can make pass@1 approach pass@N.   After chatting with many people, I also found that some of them have misunderstood how our pass@1 and pass@3 results come out. They are all in the setting where Alita doesn't have any initialized MCPs. It is not that Alita did the first task, saved the MCPs generated from the first task, and then continued doing the second task iteratively. It is, of course, not a fair comparison. Instead, we construct the MCP box only after all experiments are done, and pass@1 & pass@3 are calculated. Then we connect the MCP box to Alita, which can make pass@1 approach pass@N. Maybe we can refer to this version as Alita Pro :)",
                "Claude-Sonnet-4 vs Claude-3.7-Sonnet: Another interesting observation is that when we replace Claude-3.7-sonnet with Claude-sonnet-4, the accuracy on Level1 significantly decreases from 96.23% pass@3 to 88.68% though the overall performance increases. We have not fully understood the reasons behind this phenomenon.",
                "[IMAGE] In contrast to the prevailing trend of growing complexity, we propose a radically simple design philosophy built on two principles: i) Minimal Predefinition: Equip the agent with only a minimal set of core capabilities, avoiding manually engineered components for specific tasks or modalities; ii) Maximal Self-Evolution: Empower the agent to autonomously create, refine, and reuse external capabilities as needed. We instantiate this vision through Alita, a generalist agent built with a single core capability (i.e., the web agent) and a small set of general-purpose modules that enable self-directed capability expansion. Specifically, we take advantage of the Model Context Protocols (MCPs) which is an open protocol that standardizes how different systems provide context to LLMs, and empower Alita to dynamically generate, adapt, and reuse MCPs based on the demands of each task rather than relying on static, predefined tools. This shift from manually designed capabilities to on-the-fly MCP construction unlocks a new path for building agents that are simple yet profoundly capable.",
                "Auto MCP Creation vs Auto Tool Creation: Additional benefits of MCP creation over tool creation include better reusability and easier environment management. Auto MCP creation might be the future mainstream",
                "Alita-generated MCP Box has two benefits. i)Agent Distillation: The reuse of auto-generated MCPs can be viewed as a way of distillation, which is much cheaper and easier than traditional distillation. Stronger Agent teaches Weaker Agent: These MCPs can be reused by other weaker agents and improve their performance since Alita, instead of human developers, designs a set of useful MCPs fit to GAIA by trial and error. Agent with Larger LLMs teaches Agent with Smaller LLMs: These MCPs can also be reused by agents with smaller LLMs and significantly improve the performance. ii)Make Pass@1 approach Pass@N The MCP Box can also be connected to Alita, and makes pass@1 approach Pass@N.",
                "We manually test some agent products on GAIA. Some companies may falsely advertise their agent performance. Additionally, the GAIA validation dataset contains at least 4-5 incorrect answers, making it impossible to achieve close to 100% accuracy. One of the simplest ways to achieve 100% accuracy on GAIA validation is to integrate a HuggingFace search tool into the agent.",
                "There’s a gap between the GAIA validation and test datasets. In detail, the GAIA test dataset focuses more on web browsing ability and less on tool use. Our web agent is very simple and supports very few actions, but it is enough for the validation dataset. However, our performance drops a lot on the GAIA test, though we still rank high. With the MCP creation component, Alita achieves around a 15% increase in pass@1 on the GAIA test dataset compared to Alita without the MCP creation component, while the increase on GAIA validation is higher.",

                "Quick overview on what has been done to train an o1-like model:\n\n- Process and Outcome Reward Models. This approach does RL and trains these 2 models to give reward/signal at the step or answer level. Given that Qwen trained a SOTA PRM, we can assume they do this.\n- LATRO (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04282) basically treats the CoT as a latent. Given prompt + cot, a good cot will lead to high likelihood of the correct answer \n- SFT on reasoning traces. \n\nDeepSeek gets rid of all this complexity and simply does RL on questions with verifiable rewards. TULU 3 style (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15124)",
                "[IMAGE] They start by trying to improve the Base Model without any supervised data. \n\nThey use Group Relative Policy Optimization (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300) with the advantage function just being the normalized outcome rewards \n\nFor the reward models, they use simple accuracy reminders (check answer within \\boxed, run test cases) + they encourage the model to put its thinking process between <think/>  tags",
                "[IMAGE] The GRPO algorithm here. Again the advantage estimation is just the outcome reward. Check out the paper linked above for more details",
                "1st interesting thing of the paper:\n> neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline.\n\nnot much else for me to add here",
                "[IMAGE] They say that they use a really simple prompt because they are more interested in observing the evolution in model outputs",
                "[IMAGE] Notice that they went straight from Base -> RL without an intermediate SFT/Instruct tuning stage as is common. They call this model R1-Zero",
                "[IMAGE] Why is this interesting?\n\nNotice how simple the entire setup is. It is extremely easy to generate synthetic prompts with deterministic answers. And with literally nothing else, it is possible to go from 0.2->0.85 AIME scores.\n\nTraining the base model directly also directly extracts that ability without having its distribution disturbed by SFT\n\nAgain, at no point did they provide reference answers or instructions. The model realizes that to achieve higher reward, it needs to CoT longer",
                "[IMAGE] With this extremely straightforward setup, the network learns to reflect/reevaluate its own answers. Again, this is done completely without supervision",
                "The problem with RL on the base model is that the reasoning process/CoT is not really readable. So, they introduce a small amount of high quality user-friendly data before the RL process such that the final model isnt a \"base model\" but rather something more \"assistant\" like",
                "Their entire pipeline is as follows:\n1) Take a few thousand samples of high quality data of the format COT + Summary and SFT the base model\n\n2) Repeat the R1 Zero process. They notice the language mixing problem still remains so they add a reward accounting for the proportion of target language words in the COT. (Interesting Note: This worsens performance slightly)\n\n3) Collect 800k accurate samples from the trained model -600K STEm, 200K general purpose.  (Note: These were the samples used to FT the other open models like Qwen, Llama etc)\n\n4) They have 1 last RL stage where they combine the verifiable rewards + preference tuning that was done for DeepSeek v3 (for alignment purposes)",
                "[IMAGE] By now, you should have seen/heard all the results. So I will just say 1 thing. I really do think this is an o1 level model. If i had to guess its ~ the same as o1 (reasoning_effort = medium)",
                "[IMAGE] They also evaluate on the distilled models and distillation really just works. They even beat Qwen's very own QwQ.\n\nAt 8B parameters, it is matching Sonnet and has surpassed GPT-4o",
                "[IMAGE] Now they have a section on the effectiveness of distillation. They train a Qwen32B model using RL and compare it with the distilled version. \n\nThe finding that this RL version is worse off (~ the same as QwQ) shows that the way forward is to RL a huge model and distill it down. \n\nThis also gives insight to the impressive performance of o1-mini. It looks like it really is just extremely well engineered distillation",
                "[IMAGE] They also have a section on their unsuccessfully attempt which i find extremely commendable to share.\n\ntldr: PRMs are hard to train and can be hacked. It should only be used for guided search rather than learning. MCTS was also not working and was too complicated",
                "DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning\nhttps://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",
                "Some thoughts:\n\nI think this is 1 of the most important papers in a while because its the first open model that is genuinely at the frontier and not just riding on the goodwill of being open. \n\nThe paper is really really simple as you can probably tell from the thread because the approach is really really simple. It really is exactly what OpenAI is good at - doing simple things but executing at an extremely high level \n\nPersonally, I'm surprised (maybe i shouldn't be) that just RL on verifiable rewards (credits to the TULU3 team for the term) works. Now that we know this recipe, we also would have something that can match o3 soon. \n\nAlso worth noting that they did alignment tuning + language consistency tuning. This hurts performance which indicates that the model could be even better. Really interesting to think about the tradeoffs here.\n\nThe way i see it there are 2 open research areas:\n- Can we improve inference time performance. Search? What is o1-pro mode doing? How is the reasoning_effort in o1 controlled?\n\n- What does this unhackable ground truth reward look like for normal domains without deterministic ground truths. I think its just LLM-as-a-Judge but done extremely well (Sonnet probably does this)"
