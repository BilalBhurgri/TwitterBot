{"title": "VGGT: Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer", "authors": ["Jianyuan Wang", "Minghao Chen", "Nikita Karaev", "Andrea Vedaldi", "Christian Rupprecht", "David Novotny"], "abstract": "We present VGGT, a feed-forward neural network that directly infers all key\n3D attributes of a scene, including camera parameters, point maps, depth maps,\nand 3D point tracks, from one, a few, or hundreds of its views. This approach\nis a step forward in 3D computer vision, where models have typically been\nconstrained to and specialized for single tasks. It is also simple and\nefficient, reconstructing images in under one second, and still outperforming\nalternatives that require post-processing with visual geometry optimization\ntechniques. The network achieves state-of-the-art results in multiple 3D tasks,\nincluding camera parameter estimation, multi-view depth estimation, dense point\ncloud reconstruction, and 3D point tracking. We also show that using pretrained\nVGGT as a feature backbone significantly enhances downstream tasks, such as\nnon-rigid point tracking and feed-forward novel view synthesis.
