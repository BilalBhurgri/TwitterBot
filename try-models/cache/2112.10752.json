{"title": "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models", "authors": ["Robin Rombach", "Andreas Blattmann", "Dominik Lorenz", "Patrick Esser", "Bj\u00f6rn Ommer"], "abstract": "By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of\ndenoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art\nsynthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation\nallows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without\nretraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel\nspace, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and\ninference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on\nlimited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility,\nwe apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In\ncontrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation\nallows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity\nreduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By\nintroducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn\ndiffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning\ninputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes\npossible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve\na new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance\non various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene\nsynthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational\nrequirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion .", "subjects": ["cs.CV"], "published": "2021-12-20T18:55:25+00:00"}
