    "The paper characterizes mechanisms enabling language models to prioritize memorized facts over in-context information, finding that pretraining frequency influences model behavior, with larger models preferring memorized answers. Attention heads can be manipulated to control this preference, demonstrating that specific heads promote geographic information, and that downweighting the memory head significantly increases in-context predictions while reducing memorized ones. This approach allows fine-grained control over model behavior without altering parameters, highlighting specialized roles of attention heads in handling factual recall tasks. The study also shows that while the memory head is effective in overriding memorized answers, generalizing this mechanism to other domains is challenging due to domain-specific specializations. The findings contribute to understanding internal model mechanics and offer a pathway for targeted model edits. Key results include the observation that increasing the frequency of a country in pretraining leads to higher memorized answer predictions, while the frequency of the",
    "This paper investigates how language models (LMs) balance between memorized and in-context information when answering factual questions, finding that the frequency of a fact in pretraining data influences the model's preference for memorized answers, and that manipulating specific attention heads can control whether the model uses in-context or memorized information, with downweighting the memory head significantly increasing in-context predictions while minimizing memorized ones."
