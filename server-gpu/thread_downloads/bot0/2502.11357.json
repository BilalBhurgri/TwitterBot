    "The paper introduces Explorer, a scalable framework for generating diverse web trajectories by leveraging exploration-driven synthesis. The framework uses a multi-agent pipeline to systematically explore websites, producing 94K trajectories across 49K unique URLs, enriched with multimedia data. Explorer outperforms existing web agent baselines in tasks like Mind2Web-Live and MiniWob++, demonstrating superior performance and generalization. The dataset is extensive, with 720K screenshots and 33M web elements, and is used to train models like Phi-3.5V and Qwen2-VL-7B, achieving strong results on both online and offline benchmarks.",
    "This paper introduces Explorer, a scalable framework for synthesizing diverse web trajectory data to train GUI agents. It leverages exploration-driven methods to generate a large dataset of 94K trajectories across 49K unique URLs, richly annotated with screenshots, HTML, and accessibility trees. The framework involves a multi-agent pipeline that iteratively refines tasks through exploration, resulting in high-quality, real-world applicable trajectories. Explorer outperforms existing baselines in multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of its data in enhancing web agent performance. The dataset includes 720K screenshots and 33M web elements, making it the largest of its kind, and the framework improves task relevance and generalization"
