    "The paper proposes SliderSpace, a framework for decomposing the visual capabilities of diffusion models into semantically orthogonal control dimensions, enabling users to explore and compose variations. It uses unsupervised learning in semantic embedding space (like CLIP) to discover directions that capture major modes of variation in the model's knowledge. Key findings include the successful decomposition of concepts like \"monster\" and \"car\" into interpretable sliders, enhancing diversity in distilled models through SliderSpace, and achieving superior performance in art style exploration compared to existing methods, with human evaluations preferring SliderSpace outputs for diversity and creativity. The framework is effective across various models, including SDXL and FLUX, and supports real-time interaction via low-rank adaptations. It addresses mode collapse in distilled models by uncovering hidden visual structures, demonstrating improved FID scores and text-image alignment.",
    "SliderSpace is a framework that automatically decomposes diffusion models' visual capabilities into semantically orthogonal and controllable directions, enabling users to explore and manipulate image generation. It leverages unsupervised learning in semantic spaces to discover meaningful variations without user-defined controls, improving diversity and interpretability in image generation. The framework uses low-rank adaptors to efficiently explore the model's latent space, demonstrating effectiveness in concept decomposition, art style exploration, and enhancing diversity in distilled models."
