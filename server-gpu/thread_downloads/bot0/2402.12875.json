    "The paper investigates the expressiveness of transformer models with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, demonstrating that CoT enables transformers to perform serial computations essential for solving inherently sequential problems, which are otherwise intractable for standard transformers. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on tasks like modular addition and permutation composition, the authors show that CoT significantly enhances the model's capacity to handle complex reasoning tasks by allowing auto-regressive generation of intermediate steps, thereby improving performance on problems requiring serial processing. Theoretical results establish that transformers with CoT can simulate circuits of varying complexities, highlighting the importance of CoT in expanding the computational capabilities of transformers beyond their inherent limitations. The study underscores the critical role of CoT in bridging the gap between parallel processing capabilities and the necessity for serial computation in complex problem-solving scenarios.",
    "The paper explores how chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts enhance transformers' ability to solve inherently serial problems by analyzing their expressiveness through circuit complexity. It shows that with CoT, transformers can perform more serial computations, enabling them to solve complex tasks requiring sequential processing, such as permutation composition and iterated squaring, which are intractable for standard transformers without CoT. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that CoT allows transformers to simulate deeper circuits, improving their capacity to handle problems beyond the parallel computation limits of traditional transformers. Empirical evaluations confirm that CoT significantly boosts performance on serial tasks, highlighting the importance of structured intermediate steps in enhancing reasoning capabilities."

  "evaluation": "Step 1: Check for factual consistency by verifying that all claims in the summaries are directly supported by the source text.\nStep 2: Assess engagingness by evaluating how well the summaries capture the significance and implications of the research for a general audience.\nStep 3: Compare the summaries to determine which one best represents the core findings and contributions of the paper.\n\nFactual Consistency Scores:\nSummary 0: 3\nSummary 1: 2\n\nEngagingness Scores:\nSummary 0: 3\nSummary 1: 2\n\nBest Summary:\n1\nOkay, let's go through the evaluation steps as instructed.\n\nStep 1: Check for factual consistency. Both summaries are based on the source text. Summary 0 mentions that CoT allows transformers to perform serial computations for inherently sequential problems, which is directly stated in the source. It also references tasks like modular addition and permutation composition, which are discussed in the paper. Summary 1 similarly states that CoT enables transformers to handle serial tasks like permutation composition and iterated squaring, which are also mentioned. Both summaries accurately reflect the source text without adding unsupported claims. However, Summary 1 mentions \"intractable for standard transformers without CoT,\" which is a minor point but still supported by the text. So both are consistent, but Summary 1 has a slight edge in capturing the key point about intractability.\n\nStep 2: Assess engagingness. Summary 0 uses more general language, explaining that",
