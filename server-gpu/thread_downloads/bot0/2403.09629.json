    "This paper presents Quiet-STaR, a method for language models to learn reasoning implicitly from text by generating rationales during training. Unlike prior methods that relied on curated datasets, Quiet-STaR trains the model on diverse internet text, enabling it to develop general reasoning skills. Key findings include improved zero-shot reasoning performance on CommonsenseQA and GSM8K datasets, with performance scaling as the number of tokens used in internal thoughts increases. The method employs a parallel sampling algorithm, custom meta-tokens for rationale marking, and a mixing head to combine predictions with and without rationales. Experimental results show that Quiet-STaR enhances the model\u2019s ability to predict challenging tokens, and that longer thoughts lead to better reasoning outcomes. Additionally, the method demonstrates that incorporating thoughts into language modeling improves the coherence and structure of generated reasoning chains.",
    "Quiet-STaR is a method for training language models to generate reasoning implicitly from text, enabling improved zero-shot direct reasoning on tasks like CommonsenseQA and GSM8K by leveraging the model's own generated thoughts during training. The method involves generating thoughts in parallel with each token, mixing predictions with and without thoughts, and using REINFORCE to optimize rationale generation, leading to enhanced reasoning capabilities and better performance on reasoning tasks. Key contributions include generalizing reasoning learning from diverse text data, implementing a parallel sampling algorithm, introducing custom meta-tokens for thought identification, and showing that non-myopic loss functions improve reasoning effectiveness."
