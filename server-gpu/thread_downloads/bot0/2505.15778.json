    "This paper proposes Soft Thinking, a training-free method that enables large language models (LLMs) to reason in a continuous concept space by replacing discrete token selection with probabilistic soft aggregation over the entire vocabulary, allowing LLMs to represent and manipulate abstract concepts more flexibly and efficiently. Soft Thinking improves reasoning accuracy and token efficiency by preserving full probability distributions at each step, enabling parallel exploration of multiple reasoning paths and reducing generation length. Empirical results on mathematical and coding benchmarks show significant accuracy gains and token savings compared to standard CoT, with Soft Thinking achieving up to 2.48 percentage point improvements in pass@1 accuracy and up to 22.4% reductions in token usage. Additionally, Soft Thinking produces more interpretable and concise intermediate reasoning steps, demonstrating enhanced reasoning capabilities and efficiency in complex problem-solving scenarios.",
    "**Summary**: Soft Thinking is a training-free method that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason in a continuous concept space by replacing discrete token selection with probabilistic soft aggregation over the entire vocabulary, allowing them to represent and process abstract concepts more flexibly. This approach preserves the full probability distribution at each step, enabling the model to explore multiple reasoning paths in parallel, which improves reasoning accuracy and token efficiency. Empirical evaluations on mathematical and coding benchmarks show that Soft Thinking consistently improves pass@1 accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4%. Additionally, the method introduces a Cold Stop mechanism to prevent generation collapse and enhance efficiency, and qualitative results demonstrate that the reasoning process remains interpretable and concise."

  "evaluation": "Step 1: Check for factual consistency. Ensure that all claims in the summary are supported by the source text.\nStep 2: Assess engagingness. Determine if the summary is engaging to a general audience.\nStep 3: Verify the scores for each summary based on the evaluation criteria.\n\nSummary 0 Score:\nFactual Consistency: 3\nEngagingness: 3\n\nSummary 1 Score:\nFactual Consistency: 3\nEngagingness: 3\n\nBest Summary: 1\nOkay, let's start by evaluating the factual consistency of each summary based on the source text.\n\nFor Summary 0, it mentions that Soft Thinking is a training-free method that replaces discrete token selection with probabilistic soft aggregation over the entire vocabulary. The source text does state that Soft Thinking replaces discrete token selection with probabilistic soft aggregation, so that's accurate. It also says that Soft Thinking improves reasoning accuracy and token efficiency by preserving full probability distributions, which aligns with the source text. The empirical results on mathematical and coding benchmarks are also mentioned, and the source text does provide these results, including the 2.48 percentage point improvement in pass@1 accuracy and 22.4% reduction in token usage. The summary also notes that Soft Thinking produces more interpretable and concise intermediate steps, which is supported by the source text. So, Summary 0 is factually consistent.\n\nNow, for Summary 1, it states that Soft Thinking is a training-free",
