    "VISUALPUZZLES is a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning in isolation from domain-specific knowledge, featuring puzzles that rely on image, question text, and basic common-sense reasoning. The dataset includes 1,168 questions across five reasoning categories (algorithmic, analogical, deductive, inductive, spatial) with varying difficulty levels and mixed image/text answer options. Models struggled to match human performance on these tasks, highlighting the importance of reasoning over domain knowledge, with results showing significant gaps in reasoning abilities, especially in analogical and inductive reasoning. The benchmark aims to disentangle reasoning from domain knowledge by minimizing reliance on specialized knowledge, providing a clear signal of progress in multimodal reasoning.",
    "VISUALPUZZLES is a new benchmark for multimodal reasoning that decouples reasoning evaluation from domain knowledge, featuring puzzles that require only visual and basic common-sense reasoning, and it aims to evaluate models' reasoning abilities without relying on specialized knowledge. The dataset includes 1,168 questions across five reasoning categories, with a focus on algorithmic, analogical, deductive, inductive, and spatial reasoning. The benchmark was designed to minimize domain knowledge dependence, with questions validated to exclude advanced math, specialized knowledge, and facts, ensuring they can be solved using only the image, question text, and basic common sense. The results show that even the best models perform below the 4th percentile of human accuracy, highlighting the significant gap in multimodal reasoning capabilities between models and humans, and that models still struggle with complex reasoning tasks like analogical and inductive reasoning, indicating the need for further advancements in model architectures and training methods."
