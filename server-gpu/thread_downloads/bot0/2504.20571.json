    "The paper demonstrates that 1-shot Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), achieving performance comparable to using thousands of examples. Key findings include the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR across various models and tasks, post-saturation generalization where test performance improves after training accuracy peaks, cross-domain generalization, increased self-reflection in responses, and the crucial role of entropy loss in promoting diverse exploration and enhancing performance. The study also highlights that a single example can suffice to substantially improve LLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities, with entropy loss alone providing notable performance boosts.",

Key findings include the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR across various models and tasks, post-saturation generalization where model performance continues to improve after training accuracy saturation, and the role of entropy loss in promoting diverse exploration and enhancing performance, even without outcome rewards. ```"
