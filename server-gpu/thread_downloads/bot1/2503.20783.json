    "This paper critically examines R1-Zero-like training by analyzing base models and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, revealing biases in optimization methods like GRPO that lead to inefficient token usage. It proposes Dr. GRPO, a modified version of GRPO that removes normalization terms to mitigate these biases, improving token efficiency. The study highlights that Qwen2.5 models inherently possess strong math-solving capabilities and that self-reflection behaviors, though present in base models, do not guarantee higher accuracy. The paper also demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enhances RL performance, and that template mismatches can hinder reasoning capabilities. Key findings include the effectiveness of Dr. GRPO in reducing optimization bias, the importance of appropriate templates for RL training, and the role of domain-specific pretraining in boosting RL ceilings.",
    "This paper critically examines R1-Zero-like training by analyzing base models and reinforcement learning (RL) components. It identifies biases in GRPO optimization, proposing Dr. GRPO to mitigate them, which enhances token efficiency. Key findings include that Qwen2.5 models excel without templates, DeepSeek-V3-Base exhibits self-reflection, and Dr. GRPO reduces response length bias, improving RL performance. The study highlights the importance of template selection and pretraining in RL success, and demonstrates that unbiased optimization leads to better model efficiency and performance."

  "evaluation": "Step 1: Check for factual consistency by verifying if all claims in the summaries are supported by the source text.\nStep 2: Assess engagingness by evaluating the summaries' ability to capture the paper's key contributions and their relevance to a general audience.\nStep 3: Determine the best summary based on the evaluation criteria.\n\nSummary 0 Scores:\nFactual Consistency: 3\nEngagingness: 3\n\nSummary 1 Scores:\nFactual Consistency: 2\nEngagingness: 2\n\nBest Summary: 0\nOkay, let's start by evaluating the two summaries based on the given criteria.\n\n**Factual Consistency (Step 1):**\n- **Summary 0** mentions that the paper critically examines R1-Zero-like training, analyzes base models and RL algorithms, identifies biases in GRPO, proposes Dr. GRPO, and highlights Qwen2.5 models' math-solving capabilities. These points are all supported by the source text. The summary also states that self-reflection doesn't guarantee higher accuracy, which is mentioned in the source. The domain-specific pretraining and template mismatches are also covered. All claims are consistent with the source.\n- **Summary 1** covers similar points but mentions that Qwen2.5 models excel without templates, DeepSeek-V3-Base exhibits self-reflection, and Dr. GRPO reduces response length bias. These are all supported by the source. However, it says \"Dr. GR",
