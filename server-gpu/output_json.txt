        "[IMAGE] Our deep learning theory paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12699) got accepted to PNAS! Introduced Layer-Peeled Model that can:\n1. predict a hitherto unknown phenomenon that we term Minority Collapse in imbalanced training;\n2. explain neural collapse discovered by Papyan, Han and Donoho.",
        "When minority collapse occurs, the deep learning classifiers on minor classes are simply identical to each other! This limitation can lead to severe fairness issues for minority groups in high-stakes decision-making",
        "Interestingly, this phenomenon is first predicted by the Layer-Peeled Model before being confirmed by our computational experiments."
