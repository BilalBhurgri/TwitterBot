    "The paper presents Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) that improve high-resolution image synthesis by training diffusion models in a latent space derived from an autoencoder, reducing computational demands and enabling efficient sampling. Key findings include enhanced performance on tasks like super-resolution and inpainting, lower computational costs compared to pixel-based models, and the ability to handle dense conditioning with high-quality outputs. LDMs achieve state-of-the-art results on ImageNet and other benchmarks, demonstrating superior FID scores and reduced resource usage. They also support text-to-image and layout-to-image synthesis through cross-attention conditioning, and are released with pretrained models for broader applicability.",
    "High-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models (LDMs) improves efficiency and quality by operating in a compressed latent space, avoiding high-dimensional pixel processing. LDMs leverage autoencoding for perceptual compression, enabling efficient training and inference, and support conditional generation via cross-attention mechanisms. They outperform pixel-based models in speed and resource usage, achieving competitive performance on tasks like super-resolution, inpainting, and text-to-image synthesis. Key findings include superior FID scores, reduced computational costs, and enhanced scalability for large-scale image generation. LDMs achieve significant improvements in FID scores compared to pixel-based models, especially with downsampling factors of 4 and 8,"
