    "The paper introduces a novel approach to phenotyped Heart Failure (HF) patients using Dutch discharge letters to infer Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) classes (HFrEF, HFmrEF, HFpEF) through natural language processing (NLP) models, comparing interpretable models like Aug-Linear with black-box models such as BERT-based and transformer-based models. It evaluates the performance of these models on structured and unstructured data, demonstrating that Aug-Linear achieves competitive results with high interpretability, particularly in distinguishing HFrEF and HFpEF, while highlighting the importance of interpretability in clinical decision-making. The study also explores the challenges of labeling data with silver labels derived from structured data and clinical texts, and emphasizes the potential of unstructured data in enhancing HF phenotyping.",
    "The paper introduces a novel approach to phenotype heart failure (HF) patients using Dutch discharge letters to infer left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) classes, comparing interpretable models like Aug-Linear with black-box models. It evaluates the performance of these models on structured and unstructured data, demonstrating that Aug-Linear achieves competitive results with high interpretability, especially when combining with structured data. The study highlights the importance of interpretability in clinical NLP, showing that Aug-Linear models provide explanations more aligned with clinical reasoning than post-hoc methods like SHAP and LIME. Key findings include improved classification accuracy and the effectiveness of using discharge letters for LVEF inference, with Aug-Linear models offering both high performance and explainability in HF phenotyping."

  "evaluation": "Step 1: Check for factual consistency by verifying that all claims in the summaries are supported by the source text.\nStep 2: Assess engagingness by evaluating how well the summaries capture the significance and relevance of the study to a broad audience.\nStep 3: Compare the summaries to determine which one best represents the study's contributions and findings.\n\nFactual Consistency Scores:\nSummary 0: 3\nSummary 1: 3\n\nEngagingness Scores:\nSummary 0: 2\nSummary 1: 3\n\nBest Summary:\n1\nOkay, let's go through the evaluation steps as outlined.\n\n**Step 1: Factual Consistency Check**\nBoth summaries accurately reflect the study's main points. Summary 0 mentions the use of Dutch discharge letters, the comparison between Aug-Linear and black-box models, and the importance of interpretability. Summary 1 also covers these points, adding details about the combination of structured data and the alignment with clinical reasoning. Both summaries are supported by the source text without introducing any unsupported claims or errors. Therefore, both summaries have a factual consistency score of 3.\n\n**Step 2: Engagingness Assessment**\nSummary 0 is somewhat engaging for those familiar with the field, as it explains the study's contributions but may not capture the broader significance as effectively. Summary 1, on the other hand, emphasizes the practical implications of the study, such as the effectiveness of discharge letters and the alignment of Aug-Linear models with",
