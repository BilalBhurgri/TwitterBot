    "This paper proposes a new sparse autoencoder called HierarchicalTopK that allows a single model to maintain interpretable features across multiple sparsity budgets, outperforming traditional SAEs in terms of sparsity vs. explained variance trade-offs. It demonstrates that the hierarchical loss enables the model to perform well at all sparsity levels, maintaining high interpretability and preventing the emergence of \"dead\" features even when \u2113\u2080 is varied at inference time. The method is computationally efficient, with the hierarchical loss being inexpensive to compute and leading to faster training times compared to conventional approaches. The results show that the HierarchicalTopK SAE achieves Pareto-optimal trade-offs between sparsity and explained variance, outperforming baseline methods like TopK and BatchTopK in both accuracy and interpretability, and is effective across different sparsity levels, including extrapolation beyond the training range.",
    "This paper proposes HierarchicalTopK, a novel sparse autoencoder training method that allows a single model to maintain interpretability and accuracy across varying sparsity budgets. Key findings include that HierarchicalTopK achieves Pareto-optimal trade-offs between sparsity and explained variance, outperforms traditional SAEs trained separately for each sparsity level, and maintains high interpretability even when \u2113 0 is adjusted during inference. Additionally, the method's hierarchical loss ensures good reconstructions at all sparsity levels and reduces computational overhead through subsampling techniques. The results demonstrate that the model can dynamically adapt to different computational constraints, offering a flexible and efficient framework for analyzing Transformer latent spaces."
