    "This paper investigates why larger language models exhibit different in-context learning (ICL) behaviors compared to smaller models. Through theoretical analysis of simplified models like linear regression and sparse parity classification, it shows that smaller models focus on important hidden features, while larger models incorporate more features, including less relevant or noisy ones. This leads to smaller models being more robust to noise and distractions, whereas larger models are more susceptible to such disturbances, resulting in poorer ICL performance. Empirical experiments on various NLP tasks confirm these findings, demonstrating that larger models are more vulnerable to label and input noise, thus highlighting the importance of understanding ICL mechanisms for safer and more effective deployment of large language models.",
    "The paper investigates why larger language models exhibit different in-context learning (ICL) behaviors compared to smaller models, revealing that smaller models prioritize important hidden features while larger models incorporate more features, including less relevant ones, leading to increased sensitivity to noise and reduced ICL performance. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on linear regression and sparse parity classification tasks, the study demonstrates that smaller models are more robust to label and input noise, while larger models are prone to overfitting prompts and forgetting prior knowledge, resulting in worse ICL outcomes. Empirical results on various NLP tasks confirm these findings, showing that larger models are more susceptible to noise and less robust, supporting the hypothesis that model scale influences ICL through feature selection and noise resilience."
