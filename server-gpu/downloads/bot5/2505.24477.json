    "Gemini 2.5 Pro outperformed other AI models in a learning arena evaluation, demonstrating strong pedagogical effectiveness through expert assessments, with educators and pedagogy experts preferring it over models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and ChatGPT-4o in majority of head-to-head matchups, and excelling in text re-levelling, short-answer assessment, and mistake identification tasks, showcasing superior alignment with pedagogical principles and supporting effective learning outcomes.  ",
    "The paper presents a learning arena evaluation comparing Gemini 2.5 Pro with other AI models in educational contexts, revealing that Gemini 2.5 Pro significantly outperforms competitors in pedagogical effectiveness, with educators and experts preferring it in 71\u201382% of head-to-head matchups. The model excels in adapting content to grade levels, providing targeted feedback, and identifying mistakes, with a 87.4% accuracy rate on a math error detection benchmark. It is praised for its human-like engagement, scaffolding learning, and avoiding direct answer provision, contrasting sharply with other models that often bypass the learning process with immediate solutions."

  "evaluation": "Step 1: Check for factual consistency by verifying that all claims in the summaries are supported by the source text.\nStep 2: Assess engagingness by evaluating how well the summaries capture the key findings and their relevance to a general audience.\nStep 3: Compare the summaries to determine which one is the best based on the evaluation criteria.\n\nFactual Consistency Scores:\nSummary 0: 3\nSummary 1: 3\n\nEngagingness Scores:\nSummary 0: 2\nSummary 1: 3\n\nBest Summary:\n1\nOkay, let's start by evaluating the factual consistency of each summary. \n\nFor Summary 0, it mentions that Gemini 2.5 Pro outperformed other models in a learning arena evaluation, with educators and experts preferring it in 71-82% of matchups. The source text states that in blind, head-to-head comparisons, educators preferred Gemini 2.5 Pro over Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, ChatGPT-4o, and OpenAI o3 in 71%, 82%, 61%, and 74% of match-ups, respectively. The summary also notes excelling in text re-levelling, short-answer assessment, and mistake identification, which are all supported by the source text. The 87.4% accuracy on the math error detection benchmark is also mentioned, which matches the source. So, Summary 0 is",
