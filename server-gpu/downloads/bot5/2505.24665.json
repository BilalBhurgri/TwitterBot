    "This paper presents a framework for learning geometry and topology on manifolds using multi-chart flows, addressing the limitations of single-chart flows which fail to capture complex topologies. By combining multiple normalizing flows, the method enables accurate geometric computation and faithful representation of topological features, as demonstrated through experiments on spheres, tori, triangular meshes, and motion capture data. The approach leverages persistent homology to validate the topological correctness, showing that multi-chart flows produce more reliable and accurate results compared to single-chart alternatives, particularly in capturing the inherent structure of non-Euclidean manifolds. The paper demonstrates that multi-chart flows can effectively model",
    "This paper proposes multi-chart flows to learn the geometry and topology of manifolds, addressing the limitations of single-chart flows which assume the manifold is globally diffeomorphic to Euclidean space. By combining multiple flows, the method captures complex geometric and topological structures, enabling accurate computation of geodesics and persistence diagrams. Key contributions include the development of numerical algorithms for geodesics on multi-chart manifolds and demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-chart flows in modeling manifolds with non-trivial topology through experiments on spheres, tori, triangular meshes, and motion capture data, showing superior performance compared to single-chart approaches."
