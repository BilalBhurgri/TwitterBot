    "The paper introduces Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) as a method for steering language models toward specific text properties in adaptive free-form summarization, showing that steering vectors can effectively influence topics, sentiment, readability, and readability, but higher steering strengths degrade text quality. It compares steering with prompting, finding that prompting preserves quality better but offers weaker control, while combining methods yields the best balance of control and quality. The study highlights the trade-off between control efficacy and text quality degradation, suggesting that hybrid approaches are essential for practical applications.",

  "evaluation": "Step 1: Check for factual consistency by verifying that all claims in the summaries are supported by the source text.\nStep 2: Assess engagingness by evaluating how well the summaries capture the key contributions and implications of the research.\nStep 3: Compare the summaries to determine which one is the most accurate and engaging.\n\nSummary 0:\nFactual Consistency: 2 (Overall consistent). The summary correctly states that CAA is used for steering in adaptive summarization, mentions the four text properties controlled (topics, sentiment, readability, toxicity), and notes the trade-off with text quality. However, it incorrectly states that \"readability\" is mentioned twice, which is a minor error.\nEngagingness: 3 (Interesting). The summary clearly explains the main contributions and the trade-off, making it accessible to a general audience.\n\nSummary 1:\nFactual Consistency: 3 (Consistent). The summary accurately reflects the key points: CAA for steering, the four text properties (topic, sentiment, readability, toxicity), the trade-off with text quality, and the combination of steering with prompting. It correctly mentions that toxicity is one of the properties, which is accurate.\nEngagingness: 3 (Interesting). The summary is concise and highlights the main findings and their implications, making it engaging for a general audience.\n\nBest Summary: 1\nOkay, let's start by evaluating the factual consistency of each summary based on the source text.\n\nFor Summary 0, it",
