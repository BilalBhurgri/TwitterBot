    "This paper proposes a framework integrating hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQCNNs) with quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) to address data scarcity in quantum machine learning, presenting two data augmentation strategies: a general strategy applicable to various HQCNN architectures and a customized strategy tailored to specific model weaknesses. The framework demonstrates that QGAN-based augmentation achieves comparable performance to classical GANs with fewer parameters, showing quantum computing's efficiency in generative modeling. Experiments on the MNIST dataset confirm the framework's effectiveness, highlighting QGANs' capability to enhance HQCNN performance and their potential in practical quantum data augmentation applications.",
