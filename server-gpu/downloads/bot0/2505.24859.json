    "This paper introduces Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) as a method to control text properties in adaptive free-form summarization, showing that steering vectors effectively influence topic focus, sentiment, and readability but degrade text quality at high steering strengths. It compares CAA with prompting, finding that prompting preserves quality better but offers weaker control, while combining methods achieves the best efficacy-quality trade-off. The study evaluates summaries on intrinsic and extrinsic quality, topical focus, sentiment, toxicity, and readability, revealing that toxicity steering is particularly challenging and often leads to text degradation. The authors conclude that hybrid approaches of steering and prompting are most effective for balancing control and quality in real-world applications.",
    "The paper evaluates the effectiveness of steering vectors, particularly Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), in adaptive free-form summarization, showing that CAA can control topical focus, sentiment, and readability but not toxicity. It finds that higher steering strengths degrade text quality, with a trade-off between control efficacy and summary quality. Prompting alone offers weaker control but better text quality, while combining steering and prompting provides the best balance. The study uses the NEWTS dataset and highlights challenges in steering toxicity and maintaining quality, suggesting hybrid approaches for practical applications. The study compares steering to prompting, finding that steering alone has limited effectiveness for toxicity but can influence other properties, while combining steering with prompting enhances control and quality trade-offs."

  "evaluation": "Step 1: Check for factual consistency by verifying that all claims in the summaries are supported by the source text.\nStep 2: Assess engagingness by determining if the summaries are interesting to a general audience.\nStep 3: Compare the summaries to determine which one is the best based on the criteria.\n\nSummary 0:\nFactual Consistency: 3 (Consistent) - The summary accurately reflects the key points of the paper, including the use of CAA, the effectiveness of steering vectors, the trade-off between control and quality, and the comparison with prompting. All claims are supported by the source text.\nEngagingness: 3 (Interesting) - The summary is clear and concise, making the key findings of the paper accessible to a general audience.\n\nSummary 1:\nFactual Consistency: 2 (Overall consistent) - The summary is mostly accurate but incorrectly states that CAA can control toxicity, which the source text indicates it cannot. This is a minor error.\nEngagingness: 3 (Interesting) - The summary is clear and provides a good overview of the paper's contributions and findings.\n\nBest Summary: 0\nAnswer:\nSummary 0\nSummary 1\nBest Summary: 0\nAnswer:\nSummary 0\nSummary 1\nBest Summary: 0\nAnswer:\nSummary 0\nSummary 1\nBest Summary: 0\nAnswer:\nSummary 0\nSummary 1\nBest Summary: 0\nAnswer:\nSummary",
