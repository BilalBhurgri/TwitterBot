    "The paper introduces a risk-aware time-series forecasting Predict-and-Optimize (RTS-PnO) framework for fund allocation, addressing the challenge of balancing prediction accuracy and decision quality by integrating uncertainty quantification with an end-to-end training approach. It proposes two methods: RTS-PtO for a two-stage solution with fixed uncertainty constraints and RTS-PnO for an end-to-end solution with adaptive uncertainty constraints. The framework shows improved performance across multiple financial datasets, achieving significant reductions in regret compared to baselines. The online experiment on WeChat Pay\u2019s cross-border payments demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed method, reducing average regret by 8.4% over 12 time slots.",
    "This paper proposes a risk-aware time-series forecasting Predict-and-Allocate (RTS-PnO) framework for fund allocation, addressing the challenge of timing in asset acquisition by integrating predictive modeling and optimization with adaptive uncertainty constraints, achieving improved decision quality through end-to-end training aligned with business objectives and demonstrating effectiveness on both offline benchmarks and online cross-border payment scenarios, reducing average regret by 8.4% compared to a product-line baseline."
