    "The paper introduces HELM, a family of fully hyperbolic large language models trained at hundred-million and billion-parameter scales, leveraging hyperbolic geometry to better align with the variable geometric structure of text data. Key contributions include the introduction of Hyperbolic Mixture-of-Curvature Experts (MICE) to enable fine-grained geometric learning, Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding (HOPE) for scalable positional encoding, Hyperbolic Multi-Head Latent Attention (HMLA) to enhance scalability and efficiency, and Hyperbolic RMSNorm for stable training. HELM outperforms Euclidean models on various benchmarks, demonstrating improved reasoning and generalization capabilities.",
    "The paper introduces HELM, a family of fully hyperbolic large language models, addressing the limitations of existing Euclidean and hyperbolic Transformers. By operating in hyperbolic space, HELM better aligns with the non-Euclidean structure of text data, leading to improved performance on benchmarks such as MMLU and ARC. Key innovations include the Mixture-of-Curvature Experts (MICE) for handling varied token curvature, Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encodings (HOPE) for efficient attention mechanisms, and Hyperbolic Multi-Head Latent Attention (HMLA) for scalability. The models achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of hyperbolic geometry in capturing the hierarchical and"
