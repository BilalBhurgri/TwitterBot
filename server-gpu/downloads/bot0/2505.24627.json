    "The paper addresses the issue of neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) models overfitting to specific constraint tightness levels in vehicle routing problems (VRP), particularly in the context of CVRP with varying capacities. It demonstrates that existing NCO methods, such as POMO, BQ, and LEHD, struggle when applied to instances with constraint tightness outside their training domain, leading to significant performance degradation. The study reveals that these models are trained on instances with moderate capacity constraints (e.g., C=50) and fail to generalize to extreme constraints like C=10 (tight) or C=500 (loose). To mitigate this, the paper proposes a training scheme that exposes models to a wide range of constraint tightnesses, along with a multi-expert module that allows the model to specialize in different constraint regimes. These modifications enhance the model\u2019s ability to handle VRP instances with varying constraint tightness, as evidenced by improved performance on CVRP and CVRPTW benchmarks. The results show that the proposed method reduces the optimality gap significantly compared to existing methods, achieving an average gap of 1.86% versus 3.71% for state-of-the-art models,",
    "The main idea seems to be about how neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods struggle with vehicle routing problems (VRP) when the constraints vary in tightness. The authors tested three NCO models (POMO, LEHD, BQ) on CVRP instances with different capacity values (C=10, 50, 500). They found that these models perform poorly when the capacity constraints are not in the \"in-domain\" range (C=50), showing significant increases in optimality gaps. "
