    "The paper presents a novel public dataset of a real-world power grid in Uruguay with two years of operational data, demonstrating that learning-based ORPD models trained on synthetic data perform poorly on real-world scenarios due to non-uniform demand and generation distributions, leading to higher MAE and constraint violations. The study highlights the need for more expressive models to handle real-world complexities in optimal reactive power dispatch. ",
    "The paper presents a real-world dataset of Uruguay's power grid, highlighting the challenges of applying learning-based ORPD models to real-world data, which exhibit non-uniform distributions and lead to higher MAE and constraint violations compared to synthetic data. The study demonstrates that traditional optimization methods like IPOPT outperform learning-based approaches on real data, emphasizing the need for more expressive models to handle real-world complexities.

The source text confirms these points: the dataset is real, the non-uniform distributions are discussed, and the MAE and constraint violations are mentioned. The conclusion about needing more expressive models is also in line with the text. No major errors here.\n\n- **Summary 1** states that traditional optimization methods like IPOPT outperform learning-based approaches on real data. The source text does mention that IPOPT is used for real data and that learning models perform worse, but the summary adds \"emphasizing the need for more expressive models\" which is slightly different.
