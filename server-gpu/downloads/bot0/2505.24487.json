    "Real-time fall prevention systems are essential for reducing injuries and economic losses from workplace falls, particularly for industrial workers like construction site laborers. Falls cause over 684,000 annual deaths and 172 million disabilities globally, with significant financial impacts, including $50 billion in U.S. healthcare costs and over 370 million euros in annual European costs. Current methods face challenges in real-time detection due to sensor data variability and environmental interference. This paper presents a novel approach combining machine learning and deep learning to detect, predict, and prevent falls, considering individual health factors and movement patterns. It employs wearable IMUs and biometric sensors to monitor posture and physiological states, enabling early intervention. The study focuses on industrial settings, addressing the specific needs of high-risk workers and incorporating adaptive mechanisms based on user characteristics to enhance accuracy and reduce false alarms.",
    "The paper presents a real-time fall prevention system using machine learning and deep learning algorithms for industrial workers, particularly those in construction, aiming to detect and predict falls to activate preventive mechanisms. It addresses challenges in real-time detection due to environmental noise and data heterogeneity, and introduces a probabilistic model incorporating biometric signals to assess fall risk. Key findings include the use of IMUs and biometric sensors to monitor movement and physiological states, a hybrid approach combining dynamic models and deep learning for fall detection and prediction, and the development of a framework for real-time fall forecasting considering future fall trajectories. The system targets SMEs and industrial settings, emphasizing the importance of adapting prevention strategies to individual user capabilities and environmental factors to reduce fall-related injuries and associated economic costs."
