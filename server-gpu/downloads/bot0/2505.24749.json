    "This paper proposes a subspace-aware moment-orthogonalization (SUMO) method for accelerating memory-efficient large language model (LLM) training. SUMO leverages low-rank structure and geometric properties of the loss landscape by performing exact singular value decomposition (SVD)-based moment orthogonalization within a low-dimensional subspace, reducing memory usage and improving convergence. The method achieves faster convergence and better performance compared to existing memory-efficient optimization methods, particularly in handling ill-conditioned scenarios and low-rank gradient structures. Experimental results on benchmark tasks and pre-training datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SUMO in reducing training memory requirements and enhancing training efficiency.",
    "This paper proposes a subspace-aware moment-orthogonalization method called SUMO to accelerate memory-efficient large language model (LLM) training. SUMO leverages low-rank structure and appropriate geometry to improve convergence and preserve memory advantages. The method uses exact SVD-based moment orthogonalization within a low-dimensional adaptive subspace, achieving faster convergence and lower computational overhead compared to existing methods like Newton-Schulz5. Experimental results show that SUMO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training efficiency and model performance on benchmarks like GLUE and C4 datasets."
