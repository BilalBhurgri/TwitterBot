    "This paper proposes Binary Cumulative Encoding (BCE) as a discrete representation for time series, combined with BinConv, a convolutional architecture optimized for handling BCE vectors. The authors evaluate their method on the ProbTS benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art results in both point and probabilistic forecasting. Key contributions include BCE's ability to preserve ordinal structure and BinConv's efficient processing of BCE sequences. The method also enables probabilistic output through bin-level distribution modeling. The paper highlights the effectiveness of BCE in capturing temporal dynamics and demonstrates superior performance across diverse datasets. The authors also discuss limitations, such as discretization effects and univariate constraints, and suggest future work on multivariate extensions and broader applications.",
    "This paper proposes Binary Cumulative Encoding (BCE) as a discrete representation for time series forecasting and introduces BinConv, a convolutional architecture optimized for processing BCE vectors. The method employs BCE to capture ordinal and metric structure, enhancing model performance through a combination of 2D and 1D convolutions. BCE is transformed into a probabilistic output by modeling distributions over bins, allowing for both point and probabilistic forecasts. Extensive experiments on the ProbTS benchmark demonstrate that BinConv outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse datasets. The method is also evaluated on additional datasets, showing robustness in univariate forecasting. The paper addresses limitations such as discretization errors and the need for careful bin selection, while highlighting the importance of maintaining computational efficiency and avoiding overfitting through its design choices."
