    "Answer: This paper proposes K-Steering, a method for multi-attribute control in language models by extending non-linear gradient-based steering to handle multiple attributes simultaneously. Unlike prior methods that independently control each attribute, K-Steering uses a single classifier to learn a joint representation of multiple behaviors, allowing for unified control. Experiments show that K-Steering outperforms baselines in steering effectiveness and maintains model coherence, demonstrating its utility in guiding language models toward desired behaviors without retraining.",
    "Beyond linear steering, the paper proposes K-Steering, a method for multi-attribute control in language models using a unified non-linear classifier to guide behavior adjustments. It demonstrates improved performance over baselines in controlling multiple attributes simultaneously and provides datasets for evaluation. "
