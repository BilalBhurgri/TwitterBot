    "This paper critically examines the R1-Zero-like training paradigm, highlighting biases in the GRPO algorithm, proposing Dr. GRPO to mitigate these biases, and demonstrating that the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational resources. The analysis reveals that base models already possess strong reasoning capabilities and that self-reflection behaviors do not necessarily correlate with improved performance. Key findings include the effectiveness of Dr. GRPO in improving token efficiency, the importance of proper templates in question-answering, and the role of domain-specific pretraining in enhancing RL performance.",
    "The paper critically examines R1-Zero-like training by analyzing base models and reinforcement learning (RL), identifying biases in the GRPO algorithm that lead to inefficient optimization and longer incorrect responses. It proposes Dr. GRPO, which removes normalization terms to achieve unbiased optimization, improving token efficiency. The study highlights that Qwen2.5 models already exhibit strong math-solving capabilities and self-reflection, while DeepSeek-V3-Base also shows self-reflection. The analysis reveals that template usage affects RL performance and that domain-specific pretraining enhances RL effectiveness. The paper concludes that R1-Zero-like training benefits from unbiased optimization and careful selection of base models and templates."

  "evaluation": "Step 1: Check for factual consistency by verifying if all claims in the summaries are supported by the source text.\nStep 2: Assess engagingness by evaluating the clarity and interest level of the summaries for a general audience.\nStep 3: Compare the summaries to determine which one is the best based on the criteria.\n\nSummary 0 Scores:\nFactual Consistency: 2\nEngagingness: 3\n\nSummary 1 Scores:\nFactual Consistency: 3\nEngagingness: 2\n\nBest Summary: 1\nOkay, let's start by evaluating the two summaries based on the given criteria.\n\n**Factual Consistency (Step 1):**\n- **Summary 0** mentions that the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal resources. The source text supports this, stating that the model was trained with 27 hours on 8 A100 GPUs and achieved high accuracy. However, it also states that self-reflection doesn't necessarily correlate with improved performance, which is mentioned in the source. The summary correctly notes that base models already have strong reasoning capabilities, which is supported by the analysis in the paper. However, the summary might be slightly inconsistent in the part about the Qwen2.5 models being pretrained on concatenated texts, which is mentioned in the source. But since the summary doesn't make a major error, it's mostly consistent.\n- **Summary 1** accurately describes",
