    "This paper challenges the notion that deep learning is inherently mysterious or different from other model classes, arguing that phenomena like overparametrization, benign overfitting, and double descent are not unique to neural networks and can be explained using established generalization frameworks such as PAC-Bayes and countable hypothesis bounds. The authors propose that soft inductive biases, rather than hard constraints, are key to understanding generalization, emphasizing flexibility and a preference for simple solutions. They demonstrate that these behaviors can be replicated with simpler models like linear regressions, and that generalization is intuitively understandable through concepts like effective dimensionality and Kolmogorov complexity. The paper concludes that deep learning does not require rethinking generalization and highlights that many of its characteristics are already well-explained by existing theories.",
    "Deep learning is not inherently mysterious or different from other model classes, as many generalization phenomena like benign overfitting, double descent, and overparametrization are not unique to neural networks and can be explained using established frameworks such as PAC-Bayes and countable hypothesis bounds. The paper argues that these behaviors are better understood through soft inductive biases, which allow flexible hypothesis spaces combined with preferences for certain solutions, rather than restriction biases. It emphasizes that these phenomena are not novel to deep learning and that significant progress has been made in understanding them, which challenges the common belief that deep learning requires rethinking generalization."
