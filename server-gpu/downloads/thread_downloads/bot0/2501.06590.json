    "This paper proposes a self-updating library system called ChemAgent to enhance chemical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). ChemAgent addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs in handling complex chemical problems by decomposing tasks into atomic sub-tasks, utilizing a structured memory system with planning, execution, and knowledge components, and dynamically updating its library based on prior problem-solving experiences. The library stores decomposed sub-tasks and their solutions, enabling LLMs to recall and refine solutions from previous tasks, leading to improved accuracy and performance. Experimental results show that ChemAgent outperforms existing methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements across various datasets, especially for stronger base models like GPT-4, with an average improvement of 37% and a maximum of 46% over direct reasoning. The system's self-learning and memory-enhanced reasoning processes contribute to its effectiveness in solving complex chemical problems.",
    "**Summary**: The paper proposes a novel approach called ChemAgent to enhance chemical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by introducing a self-updating library system that stores and retrieves sub-tasks and solutions. This library enables iterative problem-solving through dynamic memory components such as Planning Memory, Execution Memory, and Knowledge Memory, which facilitate task decomposition, reasoning, and solution refinement. The system improves accuracy by leveraging past experiences and continuously updating its knowledge base, outperforming existing methods like StructChem by up to 46% in some datasets. Experiments on four chemical reasoning datasets from SciBench demonstrate that ChemAgent significantly enhances performance, with an average accuracy increase of 37% over base models and 10% over the state-of-the-art StructChem. The self-evolution of the library during runtime further boosts performance, showcasing the effectiveness of the self-updating memory system in improving chemical reasoning capabilities."
