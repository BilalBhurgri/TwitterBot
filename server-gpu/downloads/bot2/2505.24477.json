    "This paper presents a learning arena evaluation comparing Gemini 2.5 Pro with other AI models, showing that Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforms competitors in pedagogical effectiveness and user satisfaction. Educators and experts found it superior in guiding learning, managing cognitive load, inspiring active learning, deepening metacognition, and adapting to student needs. The model excels in text re-levelling, short-answer assessment, and mistake identification, with 71%-82% preference in head-to-head matches. The study highlights the importance of sustained, adaptive tutoring over one-off interactions and underscores the value of human-like pedagogical approaches in AI for learning.",
    "Gemini 2.5 Pro outperformed other models in pedagogical effectiveness, demonstrated superior performance in text re-levelling and short-answer assessment tasks, and received strong educator and pedagogy expert preference in multi-turn evaluations, with educators preferring it over Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, ChatGPT-4o, and OpenAI o3 in 71%, 82%, 61%, and 74% of match-ups respectively, indicating its superiority in applying pedagogical principles and supporting effective learning.
