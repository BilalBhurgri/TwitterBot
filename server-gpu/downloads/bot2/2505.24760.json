    "The paper introduces Reasoning Gym (RG), a library of procedurally generated reasoning tasks for training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning. RG features algorithmically verifiable tasks across diverse domains, enabling scalable and automated training with verifiable rewards. Key findings include significant performance gaps between reasoning-optimized and general-purpose models, with RLVR improving reasoning capabilities across domains. RG demonstrates cross-domain transfer, where models trained on algorithmic tasks excel in math domains like algebra and geometry. The study highlights the difficulty cliff phenomenon, where performance degrades sharply with increasing task difficulty, indicating limited reasoning robustness. Additionally, RG shows skill transfer to external benchmarks like MATH and GSM8K, with RLVR training leading to notable improvements. The paper concludes that RG effectively enhances LLM reasoning through structured, automatable tasks and reinforces the potential of RLVR for advancing AI reasoning capabilities.",
