    "This study introduces a novel method for phenotyping heart failure patients using Dutch discharge letters, employing natural language processing to infer left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) classes (HFrEF, HFmrEF, HFpEF) from unstructured text. The approach combines structured and unstructured data, utilizing interpretable models like Aug-Linear to achieve high classification accuracy and provide interpretable explanations. Key contributions include developing a strategy for LVEF classification without explicit LVEF values, creating the first model for Dutch discharge letters, and conducting an in-depth analysis of model interpretability. The study compares black-box models with interpretable models, demonstrating that Aug-Linear models perform competitively with state-of-the-art models while offering transparent explanations, which are crucial for clinical decision-making. The results show that Aug-Linear models achieve high AUC on external validation, with improved interpretability compared to post-hoc explanations of black-box models. The study highlights the importance of interpretability in clinical NLP, emphasizing the need for transparent and trustworthy models in healthcare applications.",
    "This study investigates the use of Dutch discharge letters for phenotyping heart failure (HF) patients into left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) classes (HFrEF, HFmrEF, HFpEF) using natural language processing (NLP) models, comparing interpretable models like Aug-Linear with black-box models such as MedRoBERTa.nl. The researchers developed a strategy to infer LVEF classes from unstructured clinical texts, combining silver labels derived from structured data (diagnoses, echocardiograms) and textual mentions. They evaluated the performance of various NLP models on a large dataset of HF patients, demonstrating that Aug-Linear models achieved high accuracy and provided interpretable explanations aligned with clinical annotations, outperforming black-box models in classification and offering better interpretability for clinical decision-making."
