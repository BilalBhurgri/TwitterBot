    "This paper proposes a multi-chart flow method to learn the geometry and topology of data manifolds, addressing the limitations of single-chart flows by using multiple charts to properly cover the data manifold while respecting its geometric and topological structure. The method computes geodesics and other geometric quantities via normalizing flows, allowing for accurate modeling of complex manifolds. Through experiments on spheres, tori, triangular meshes, and motion capture data, the method demonstrates superior performance in capturing topological features and maintaining geometric consistency compared to single-chart approaches. The paper also introduces a probabilistic framework for handling overlapping charts and ensures robustness in geometric computations by leveraging responsibilities from the EM algorithm. The results highlight the effectiveness of multi-chart flows in representing non-trivial topologies and achieving accurate geometric inference on learned manifolds.",
    "This paper proposes a multi-chart flow method to learn the geometry and topology of data manifolds, addressing the limitations of single-chart flows which assume the manifold is globally diffeomorphic to Euclidean space. By combining multiple charts, the method captures the intrinsic geometric and topological structure, enabling accurate computation of geodesics and other geometric quantities. The method uses a mixture of normalizing flows, with training involving EM algorithms and careful initialization. Experiments on spheres, tori, triangular meshes, and motion capture data show that the multi-chart approach achieves superior performance in reconstructing the manifold and capturing its topology, as evidenced by improved persistence diagrams and reduced reconstruction errors compared to single-chart methods. The paper demonstrates that multi-chart flows provide a robust framework for modeling complex data manifolds with non-trivial topology."
