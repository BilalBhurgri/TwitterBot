    "AutoChemSchematic AI is a closed-loop, physics-aware agentic framework for automatically generating chemical process and instrumentation diagrams, integrating domain-specific small language models (SLMs) with physics-aware validation to enable end-to-end automation. The framework employs a multi-stage SLM fine-tuning process, leveraging synthetic datasets and retrieval augmentation from a hierarchical chemical knowledge graph, combined with rigorous simulation-based validation using DWSIM. Results demonstrate that the synergy between fine-tuning and Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables high-fidelity PFD/PID generation with strong generalization capabilities, particularly in zero-shot synthesis of novel chemical processes and core engineering QA tasks, including PFD/PID interpretation and analysis. The framework effectively bridges the gap between digital discovery and industrial deployment, addressing key R&D bottlenecks by automating the generation of process flow and instrumentation descriptions for novel chemical processes.",

  "evaluation": "1. Check for factual consistency by verifying if all claims in the summaries are supported by the source text.\n2. Assess engagingness by determining if the summaries are interesting to a general audience.\n3. Compare the summaries to select the best one based on the evaluation criteria.\n\nSummary 0 Factual Consistency: 3\nSummary 0 Engagingness: 3\nSummary 1 Factual Consistency: 3\nSummary 1 Engagingness: 3\nBest Summary: 0\nOkay, let's start by evaluating the factual consistency of each summary. \n\nFor Summary 0, I need to check if all the claims are supported by the source text. The summary mentions that AutoChemSchematic AI is a closed-loop, physics-aware agentic framework that integrates domain-specific SLMs with physics-aware validation. The source text does talk about a closed-loop framework, physics-aware validation, and the integration of SLMs. It also mentions the use of synthetic datasets, retrieval augmentation from a knowledge graph, and DWSIM for validation. The summary accurately reflects these points, so it's consistent.\n\nNow, Summary 1 also states similar things: closed-loop, physics-aware, SLMs, DWSIM, and the benefits of the framework. The source text supports all these elements. The summary correctly highlights the multi-stage fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, and simulation-based validation. So, both summaries are factually consistent.\n\nNext, assessing engagingness. Summary",
