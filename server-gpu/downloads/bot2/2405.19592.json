    "This paper investigates why larger language models exhibit different in-context learning (ICL) behaviors compared to smaller models. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, it shows that smaller models focus on essential hidden features, making them more robust to noise, while larger models incorporate more features, including less relevant or noisy ones, leading to poorer ICL performance in noisy environments. Theoretical derivations and empirical results support the hypothesis that the scale of the model influences its sensitivity to noise and its ability to retain pretraining knowledge, highlighting differences in how attention mechanisms operate across varying model sizes. Answer: This paper investigates why larger language models exhibit different in-context learning (ICL) behaviors compared to smaller models.",
    "The paper investigates why larger language models exhibit different in-context learning (ICL) behaviors compared to smaller models. Through theoretical analysis of simplified models (linear regression and sparse parity classification), it shows that smaller models focus on important hidden features while larger models incorporate more features, including less relevant or noisy ones. This leads to smaller models being more robust to noise and label errors, whereas larger models are more susceptible to distractions, resulting in worse ICL performance. Empirical experiments on NLP tasks confirm these findings, demonstrating that larger models are more affected by noise and label flipping, aligning with the theoretical predictions. Answer: The paper investigates why"
