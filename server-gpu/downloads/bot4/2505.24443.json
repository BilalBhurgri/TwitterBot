    "The paper proposes a novel open-set semi-supervised learning framework, Diversify and Conquer (DAC), which addresses the challenge of identifying outliers in unlabeled data by leveraging prediction disagreements among multiple models trained on different subsets of unlabeled data. The framework introduces a shared encoder with divergent heads to estimate sample-wise uncertainties and detect outliers through consensus scores. DAC outperforms existing methods in both closed-set and open-set classification accuracy, particularly under conditions of underspecified labeled data, by effectively reducing the impact of outliers on the SSL objective through a combination of mutual information loss, open-set knowledge distillation, and soft rejection strategies. The method is validated on multiple datasets, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling real-world scenarios with limited labeled data and outliers.",
    "This paper proposes a novel framework called Diversify and Conquer (DAC) for open-set semi-supervised learning (OSSL) to address the challenges posed by outliers in unlabeled data. DAC introduces a method to estimate sample-wise uncertainties by leveraging prediction inconsistencies across multiple models trained on diverse subsets of unlabeled data. The framework constructs diverse functions through a single training process using a shared encoder with multiple heads, enabling robust outlier detection by measuring consensus scores among predictions. The method effectively handles underspecified labeled data scenarios by reducing the impact of potential outliers through uncertainty estimation and reweighting strategies, outperforming existing OSSL methods in both closed-set and open-set classification accuracy. Key findings include improved performance on standard SSL benchmarks and enhanced robustness against outliers, demonstrating the effectiveness of DAC in addressing open-set SSL challenges."
