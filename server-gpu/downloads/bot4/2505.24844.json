    "CHAMELEON is a flexible data-mixing framework for language model preprocessing and fine-tuning, utilizing Kernel Ridge Leverage Scores (KRLS) to determine domain weights based on embedding data, enhancing universal generalization and adapting to domain changes without retraining proxy models, achieving competitive performance with reduced computational costs compared to DoReMi and DoGE, and extending domain reweighting to fine-tuning for improved task-specific knowledge. ",
    "CHAMELEON is a flexible data-mixing framework that uses Kernel Ridge Leverage Scores (KRLS) to compute domain weights, improving universal generalization and adapting to domain changes without frequent retraining. It efficiently handles both pretraining and fine-tuning by leveraging domain embeddings and affinity matrices, achieving performance comparable to DoReMi and DoGE at a fraction of the cost, and excels in downstream tasks and scalability.
