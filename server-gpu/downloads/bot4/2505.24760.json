    "The paper introduces Reasoning Gym (RG), a framework for training reinforcement learning (RL) models with verifiable rewards, aiming to enhance reasoning abilities through diverse, algorithmically verifiable tasks. RG addresses challenges in benchmarking by offering open-ended, dynamically adjustable tasks across domains like algebra, games, and logic. Key findings include significant performance gaps between reasoning-optimized and general-purpose models, demonstrating that RLVR enables broader reasoning skills. The study shows cross-domain transfer, with models trained on algorithmic tasks improving in math domains. RG also facilitates curriculum learning, accelerating training and improving accuracy. Additionally, RG's tasks transfer to external benchmarks like MATH and GSM8K, highlighting the effectiveness of RLVR in developing generalizable reasoning abilities. The paper emphasizes that RG provides a scalable, automated environment for advancing AI reasoning through structured, procedurally generated challenges.",
    "This paper introduces the Reasoning Gym (RG), a comprehensive library of procedural dataset generators and algorithmically verifiable reasoning environments for training models with reinforcement learning. RG enables exploration of diverse reasoning skills across multiple domains, showcasing significant improvements in reasoning capabilities through RLVR. Key findings include the effectiveness of RLVR in improving performance across various domains, demonstrating cross-domain transfer capabilities, and the importance of algorithmic verifiability and large solution spaces in fostering generalizable reasoning skills. Additionally, the study highlights the challenges posed by increasing task difficulty, revealing the fragility of current reasoning models and the necessity for more robust training methods. RG also facilitates skill transfer to external benchmarks, with models trained on RG tasks showing improved performance on established benchmarks like MATH and GSM8K. The paper concludes with the potential of RG as a tool for advancing reasoning abilities in large language models."
