    "The paper presents Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), which use autoencoders to compress images into a latent space before diffusion modeling, enabling efficient high-resolution image synthesis. LDMs improve upon pixel-based diffusion models by reducing computational costs, achieving competitive performance on tasks like image synthesis, inpainting, and super-resolution, and offering better quality and efficiency through latent space compression. They outperform existing methods in terms of FID scores and reduce training/inference times significantly, with applications in text-to-image generation and semantic tasks. The authors also release pretrained models for broader usage.",
    "High-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models (LDMs) reduces computational demands by operating in a latent space, improving efficiency and quality. LDMs combine autoencoding with diffusion models to achieve better performance in tasks like super-resolution, inpainting, and text-to-image generation, with significant reductions in training and inference costs compared to pixel-based methods. They outperform existing models in FID scores and offer flexible conditioning mechanisms, enabling diverse applications and reducing resource consumption while maintaining high-quality outputs."
