    "This paper explores the effectiveness of contrastive activation addition (CAA) steering vectors for adaptive free-form summarization, demonstrating that steering can influence topics, sentiment, readability, and toxicity, though higher steering strengths degrade text quality. It compares steering with prompting and their combination, finding that steering alone offers stronger control but at the expense of quality, while combined methods provide balanced efficacy-quality trade-offs. The study highlights the practical challenges of steering in real-world NLP tasks and suggests hybrid approaches as a promising solution for aligning LLMs with user preferences.",
    "This paper introduces Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) as a method to control text properties in adaptive free-form summarization, showing that CAA effectively influences topical focus, sentiment, readability, but not toxicity, with higher steering strengths degrading summary quality. It compares CAA to prompting, finding that prompting preserves quality better but offers weaker control, while combining both methods achieves the best balance of control and quality. The study evaluates summaries on intrinsic and extrinsic quality, topical focus, sentiment, toxicity, and readability, revealing that toxicity steering is particularly challenging and prone to text degradation. The results highlight a trade-off between steering efficacy and text quality, suggesting that hybrid approaches combining steering and prompting are most effective for practical applications in natural language processing. The authors also release their code and datasets to promote reproducibility.  "

  "evaluation": "Step 1: Check for factual consistency by verifying that all claims in the summaries are supported by the source text.\nStep 2: Assess engagingness by determining if the summaries are interesting to a general audience.\nStep 3: Compare the summaries to determine which one is the best based on the criteria.\n\nSummary 0:\nFactual Consistency: 3 (Consistent) - The summary accurately reflects the paper's main points, including the use of CAA for steering, the trade-off between control and quality, and the comparison with prompting and their combination. All claims are supported by the source text.\nEngagingness: 3 (Interesting) - The summary is clear and concise, making the key findings and implications accessible to a general audience.\n\nSummary 1:\nFactual Consistency: 2 (Overall consistent) - The summary is mostly accurate but incorrectly states that CAA does not influence toxicity, while the source text mentions that toxicity can be influenced but with challenges. This is a minor error.\nEngagingness: 3 (Interesting) - The summary is well-structured and highlights the key contributions and findings, making it engaging for a general audience.\n\nBest Summary: 1\nOkay, let's start by evaluating the two summaries based on the given criteria.\n\n**Factual Consistency for Summary 0:**\n- The summary correctly states that CAA is used for steering in adaptive summarization.\n- It mentions the trade-off between control and quality, which is accurate.",
