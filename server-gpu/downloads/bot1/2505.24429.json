    "Deep learning models, particularly GraphCast and ConvLSTM, were evaluated for subregional ocean forecasting in the Canary Current Upwelling System (CCUS), showing that GraphCast outperformed ConvLSTM and traditional reanalysis (GLORYS) in SST forecasting with significant RMSE reductions of 75.5% at 5-day lead times and 47% at 10-day lead times, achieving 76% and 48% lower RMSE than GLORYS. GraphCast also demonstrated superior spatial accuracy, with 22.96% of ocean cells exceeding instrumental error thresholds at 8-day lead times compared to 100% for ConvLSTM, and consistently lower RMSE values across all lead times. However, GraphCast exhibited higher sensitivity to initial condition errors and triangular artifacts, necessitating hybrid architectures for improved robustness. The study highlights the potential of deep learning in operational oceanography, with GraphCast's high computational efficiency (forecasting 20-day SST in 2.3 minutes) and ability to capture complex mesoscale dynamics, while acknowledging the need for further improvements in handling observational errors and hybrid modeling strategies.",
    "The paper presents a study on deep learning models for subregional ocean forecasting, specifically in the Canary Current Upwelling System (CCUS). It compares GraphCast and ConvLSTM against GLORYS reanalysis, finding that GraphCast achieves significantly lower RMSE and higher ACC for SST forecasts, with over 76% and 48% reductions at 5- and 10-day lead times, respectively. GraphCast also shows superior spatial accuracy and performance in coastal upwelling zones, though it is sensitive to initial condition errors and exhibits triangular artifacts at longer lead times. The study highlights the potential of deep learning for operational oceanography, noting that GraphCast's computational efficiency (20-day forecasts in 2.3 minutes) and accuracy make it a promising alternative to traditional models like GLORYS, while acknowledging the need for hybrid approaches to balance accuracy and robustness."
