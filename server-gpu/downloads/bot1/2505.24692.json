    "The summary includes key findings: the introduction of Quick-Draw Bandits, their efficiency in learning Lipschitz functions in both continuous and non-stationary settings, the O(\u221aT) regret bound for stationary cases, and superior performance in experiments across various scenarios. It aligns with the paper's content without adding extraneous information. The summary is concise and factual, capturing the main contributions and results presented in the paper.",
    "Quick-Draw Bandits is a new multi-armed bandit policy that efficiently learns Lipschitz reward functions over a continuous feature space and extends to non-stationary environments by modifying the policy. The paper proves that the method achieves O*(T) cumulative regret on stationary Lipschitz payouts, which is comparable to Gaussian Process policies, and validates the policy on simulated and real-world datasets showing significant improvements in performance, particularly in non-stationary settings and for large numbers of arms. The policy incorporates both spatial and temporal dependencies, outperforms existing methods like \u03b5-greedy, restless bandits, and SW-GP-UCB in simulations and real-world applications such as the Open Bandit dataset, achieving a 65% relative"

Summary 0 mentions the introduction of Quick-Draw Bandits, their efficiency in learning Lipschitz functions in both continuous and non-stationary settings, the O(\u221aT) regret bound for stationary cases, and superior performance in experiments. These points are all supported by the paper. Summary 1 talks about the policy being a new multi-armed bandit policy that extends to non-stationary environments, achieving O*(T) regret, and outperforming existing methods like \u03b5-greedy, restless bandits, and SW-GP-UCB. However, the source text states that the method achieves O*(T) regret for stationary Lipschitz payouts, not O*(T) in general. Also, the",
