    "The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the test error of linear DAEs with and without skip connections, demonstrating that skip connections contribute to a smoother generalization curve by reducing the variance term in the test error, particularly when the model is only mildly overparameterized. It highlights the role of skip connections in stabilizing the generalization performance of DAEs, especially in the presence of noise and moderate overparameterization.",
    "The paper investigates the impact of bottleneck layers and skip connections on the generalization of linear denoising autoencoders (DAEs), revealing that bottleneck dimensions act as a complementary complexity measure, and that skip connections smooth the test error curve by reducing variance, especially in mildly overparameterized settings, with theoretical analyses showing that the bias-variance trade-off in DAEs is governed by the bottleneck layer size, and that the presence of skip connections leads to a more stable generalization performance.
