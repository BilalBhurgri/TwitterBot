    "This paper introduces DexMachina, a curriculum-based reinforcement learning algorithm for functional retargeting in dexterous hand manipulation. It addresses the challenges of long-horizon, bimanual tasks by using virtual object controllers and auxiliary rewards to guide policy learning, enabling efficient adaptation across different dexterous hands. The algorithm outperforms baseline methods on a benchmark with six dexterous hands and five articulated objects, demonstrating superior performance on long-horizon tasks. Key findings include significant improvements in task success rates, the effectiveness of the curriculum in overcoming early failure issues, and the ability to generalize across various hand designs and object types. The paper also proposes a standardized evaluation benchmark for dexterous hands, facilitating future research and comparisons. ",
    "This paper proposes DexMachina, a curriculum-based reinforcement learning algorithm for functional retargeting in dexterous robotic hands, which learns policies to manipulate objects by mimicking human demonstrations. The algorithm uses virtual object controllers and auxiliary rewards to guide the policy through a curriculum, starting with high controller strength and gradually decreasing it to allow the policy to take over. It addresses challenges in long-horizon, bimanual tasks by enabling efficient exploration and adapting to hardware constraints. Experimental results show DexMachina outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating strong performance across various dexterous hands and tasks, and establishes a benchmark for evaluating different robotic hand designs."
