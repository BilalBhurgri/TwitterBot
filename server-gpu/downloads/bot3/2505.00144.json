    "Okay, let me start by reading through the user's query and the provided paper. The user wants a 150-word summary based on the instructions. The key points from the paper include the evolution of IRBL techniques into three generations, the integration of deep learning (DL) in the third generation, challenges like lexical gaps, structural information neglect, and cold-start problems, and the effectiveness of DL in addressing these issues. I need to make sure the summary is factual, includes the key findings, and doesn't add any extra information. Let me check the paper again to confirm the main points. The paper mentions that DL-based IRBL has evolved from three generations, with the third generation focusing on semantic information. It also discusses challenges such as lexical gaps between bug reports and code, ignoring code structure, and cold-start problems in new projects. The study reviews 61 DL-based IRBL studies,",
    "This paper reviews the application of deep learning in information retrieval-based bug localization, highlighting the evolution of IRBL techniques from the first to the third generation, emphasizing the integration of semantic information and deep learning models, and discusses challenges such as lexical gaps, code structure neglect, cold-start problems, and the need for cross-project and cross-language localization, while proposing a comprehensive survey of 61 studies to identify current techniques, performance metrics, and open challenges in DL-based IRBL."

  "evaluation": "1. Check if the summary accurately reflects the paper's main points: evolution of IRBL into three generations, DL integration in third generation, challenges like lexical gaps, code structure neglect, cold-start, and the survey of 61 studies.\n2. Ensure the summary is concise, avoids jargon, and is understandable to a general audience.\n3. Verify that the summary does not include any unsupported claims or errors.\n\nFactual Consistency Scores:\nSummary 0: 2\nSummary 1: 3\n\nEngagingness Scores:\nSummary 0: 2\nSummary 1: 3\n\nBest Summary:\n1\nOkay, let's see. The user provided two summaries and asked for evaluation based on factual consistency and engagingness. \n\nFirst, I need to check if each summary accurately reflects the paper's content. The paper discusses the three generations of IRBL techniques, with the third generation using DL. It also mentions challenges like lexical gaps, code structure neglect, and cold-start problems. The survey includes 61 studies.\n\nSummary 0 mentions the three generations, DL integration, challenges, and the survey. It's concise but might have some minor issues. Summary 1 also covers the same points but is more detailed. \n\nFor factual consistency, Summary 1 seems more accurate as it includes all key points without errors. Summary 0 might have a minor error in the number of studies (61 vs. 61, but that's correct). \n\nEng",
