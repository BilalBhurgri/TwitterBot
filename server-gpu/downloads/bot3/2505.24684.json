    "This paper investigates the implicit inductive bias in factorized VAEs, revealing that disentangling granularity\u2014a property determining the model\u2019s tendency to disentangle features of varying complexity\u2014is governed by the factorized prior. The authors propose a novel method, beta-STCVAE, which enables explicit tuning of disentangling granularity through total correlation decomposition. By training over 100K factorized VAEs, the study identifies a \"V\"-shaped optimal ELBO trajectory, showing that fixed disentangling granularity in conventional VAEs limits their ability to disentangle high-complexity features. The results demonstrate that beta-STCVAE outperforms existing methods in both representation learning and disentanglement, highlighting the importance of disentangling granularity as an implicit inductive bias in VAEs.",
    "This paper investigates the implicit inductive bias in factorized VAEs, revealing that disentangling granularity acts as a crucial implicit inductive bias that governs the model's ability to disentangle features of varying complexity. The authors propose a novel method, beta-STCVAE, which enables explicit tuning of disentangling granularity through total correlation decomposition. They demonstrate that adjusting the disentangling granularity can improve both representation learning and disentanglement performance, with experiments showing a \"V\"-shaped optimal ELBO trajectory indicating that tuning granularity optimizes performance. The study highlights the importance of implicit inductive biases in VAEs for effective disentanglement and provides insights into the relationship between disentanglement and representation learning. Key findings include the identification of disentangling granularity as a key factor, the development of beta-STCVAE, and the observation of a \"V\"-shaped optimal ELBO trajectory in parameter space."

  "evaluation": "Step 1: Check for factual consistency by verifying if all claims in the summary are supported by the source text.\nStep 2: Assess engagingness by evaluating the summary's ability to capture the essence of the paper and its relevance to a general audience.\nStep 3: Compare the summaries to determine which one is the best based on the evaluation criteria.\n\nSummary 0 Scores:\nFactual Consistency: 3\nEngagingness: 3\n\nSummary 1 Scores:\nFactual Consistency: 3\nEngagingness: 3\n\nBest Summary: 1\nOkay, let's start by evaluating the factual consistency of each summary. \n\nFor Summary 0, it mentions that the paper investigates the implicit inductive bias in factorized VAEs, which is supported by the source text. It states that disentangling granularity is governed by the factorized prior, which aligns with the source's discussion on the factorized prior in beta-TCVAE. The proposal of beta-STCVAE and the \"V\"-shaped ELBO trajectory are also accurately reflected. The conclusion that beta-STCVAE outperforms existing methods is consistent with the experiments described. All these points are directly supported by the source text, so Summary 0 is factually consistent.\n\nSummary 1 also accurately captures the main points: the role of disentangling granularity as an implicit bias, the development of beta-STCVAE, the \"V\"-shaped ELBO",
