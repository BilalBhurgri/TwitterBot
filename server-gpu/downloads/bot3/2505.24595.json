    "This paper proposes Binary Cumulative Encoding (BCE) as a discrete representation for time series forecasting, combined with BinConv, a convolutional model that efficiently processes BCE sequences. BCE captures ordinal and metric structures by encoding values as cumulative binary indicators, enhancing model performance. The model is validated on the ProbTS benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art results in both point and probabilistic forecasting. Key innovations include BCE's preservation of ordinal relationships and BinConv's hybrid 2D/1D convolutional architecture, which balances efficiency and accuracy. The paper also discusses limitations such as discretization errors and univariate constraints, emphasizing the need for future extensions to multivariate settings.",
    "This paper proposes Binary Cumulative Encoding (BCE) as a novel discrete representation for time series forecasting and introduces BinConv, a convolutional architecture optimized for processing BCE-encoded sequences. Extensive experiments on the ProbTS benchmark demonstrate that BCE and BinConv achieve state-of-the-art results in both point and probabilistic forecasting tasks. The method addresses the limitations of one-hot encoding by preserving ordinal information and enables efficient, scalable forecasting through a lightweight CNN design. Key innovations include BCE's monotonic structure, which retains global order, and BinConv's combination of 2D and 1D convolutions for efficient feature extraction. The model outperforms existing baselines in accuracy and efficiency, with strong performance across diverse domains and datasets, and shows robustness to variations in bin selection and forecasting approaches."
