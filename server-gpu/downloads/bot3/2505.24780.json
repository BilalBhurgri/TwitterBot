    "This paper proposes a framework integrating hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQCNNs) with quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) to address data scarcity in quantum machine learning. Key findings include the effectiveness of QGANs in generating high-quality samples that enhance HQCNN performance, with QGAN achieving comparable results to deep convolutional GANs (DCGANs) using fewer parameters. The study demonstrates that QGAN-based data augmentation improves classification accuracy on the MNIST dataset, particularly in underperforming classes, and highlights quantum computing\u2019s efficiency in generative modeling. The framework also introduces two data augmentation strategies: a general strategy applicable to various HQCNN architectures and a customized strategy that dynamically adjusts sample generation based on model performance, leading to better robustness in data-scarce scenarios. The results show that QGANs outperform classical GANs and traditional data augmentation methods in terms of parameter efficiency, training speed, and sample quality, offering a promising direction for practical quantum data augmentation in real-world applications.",
    "A novel framework integrating hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQCNNs) with quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) is presented to address data scarcity in quantum machine learning, achieving superior performance in data augmentation by employing two strategies: a general strategy for broad applicability and a customized strategy to enhance robustness in challenging classes. The framework demonstrates that QGANs, with fewer parameters than deep convolutional GANs (DCGANs), match their performance on the MNIST dataset, showcasing quantum computing's efficiency in generative modeling and providing a foundation for practical quantum data augmentation in real-world applications."
