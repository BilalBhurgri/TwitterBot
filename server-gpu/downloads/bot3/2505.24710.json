    "The paper introduces a causal-aware large language models (LLMs) framework that integrates structural causal models (SCMs) to enhance decision-making through learning, adapting, and acting. The framework iteratively learns causal relationships from the environment, adapts them via causal interventions, and uses updated knowledge to guide reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Key findings show that the proposed method outperforms baselines in the Crafter environment, achieving higher success rates and scores compared to traditional RL and LLM-based methods. The approach combines causal reasoning with RL to improve policy learning, leading to more efficient and adaptive decision-making in complex tasks.",
    "This paper proposes a causal-aware large language models (LLMs) framework that integrates structural causal models (SCMs) to enhance decision-making in complex environments. The framework operates through three stages: learning, adapting, and acting, where LLMs learn causal knowledge from the environment, adapt it via causal interventions, and use it to guide RL agents in policy learning. The framework is evaluated in the Crafter environment, showing significant improvements in success rates and overall scores compared to baselines like RL-based and LLM-based methods. Key findings include that causal knowledge improves policy learning and environmental adaptation, with the method outperforming human experts and SPRING in long-term performance, and demonstrating faster achievement unlocking. The framework enables robust decision-making by combining causal reasoning with LLMs and reinforcement learning, highlighting the importance of causal awareness in complex decision-making tasks."

  "evaluation": "Step 1: Check for factual consistency by verifying if all claims in the summaries are supported by the source text.\nStep 2: Assess the engagingness by evaluating the clarity and interest level of the summaries for a general audience.\nStep 3: Compare the summaries to determine which one is the best based on the evaluation criteria.\n\nFactual Consistency Scores:\nSummary 0: 3\nSummary 1: 3\n\nEngagingness Scores:\nSummary 0: 3\nSummary 1: 3\n\nBest Summary:\n1\nOkay, let's go through the evaluation steps as instructed.\n\nStep 1: Check for factual consistency by verifying if all claims in the summaries are supported by the source text.\n\nFor Summary 0: The summary mentions that the framework integrates SCMs, operates through learning, adapting, and acting stages, and outperforms baselines in the Crafter environment. These points are all supported by the source text. The key findings about higher success rates and scores compared to traditional methods are also mentioned, which align with the paper's results. There are no major errors here.\n\nFor Summary 1: The summary states that the framework is evaluated in the Crafter environment, shows significant improvements in success rates and scores, outperforms human experts and SPRING, and demonstrates faster achievement unlocking. These points are all present in the source text. The mention of combining causal reasoning with LLMs and RL is also accurate. There are no major errors here either",
