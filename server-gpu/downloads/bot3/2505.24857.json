    "This paper proposes EB-Sampler, an entropy-bounded adaptive sampler for masked diffusion models that improves sampling efficiency and performance by selectively unmasking tokens based on model predictions and entropy bounds, achieving 2-3x speedups on coding and math benchmarks without sacrificing accuracy. It demonstrates superior efficiency and performance across various tasks, including logic puzzles and reasoning, by leveraging model-predicted low entropy tokens and adaptive unmasking strategies. Key findings include the effectiveness of entropy-based unmasking, the importance of balancing model error and joint dependence error, and the superiority of EB-Sampler over existing Top-k samplers in both efficiency and performance.",
    "This paper proposes EB-Sampler, an entropy-bounded adaptive sampler for masked diffusion models that improves sampling efficiency and maintains performance by selectively unmasking tokens based on their predicted entropy and model error. It achieves 2-3x speedups on code and math reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance, demonstrating superiority over existing samplers and providing Pareto frontiers for efficiency-performance trade-offs. Key findings include the effectiveness of unmasking tokens with low entropy and model error, the importance of adaptive unmasking orders, and the ability to handle complex tasks like logic puzzles and reasoning through efficient multi-token sampling.
